Ouput data for GRL manuscript "Parameterizing Multiple Ligand Classes Improves the Simulation of Dissolved Iron in the Subtropical North Atlantic". Files include:

1. GA03.mat and GA03_e.mat are Fe data from the GEOTRACES two GA03 cruises(zonal and meridional, respectively)
2. GA03_e_WeakerL3.mat: is the model iron ouput from the Control run
3. Fe_Strongscav_run.mat is the model iron ouput from the Strong scav. run
4. GA03_e_WeakerL3.mat and GA03_WeakerL3.mat: are the model iron ouput from the Weaker L3 run
5. Fe_Combi_run.mat is the model iron ouput from the Strong scav. + weaker L3 run 
6. Fe_Stronguptake_run.mat is the model iron ouput from the Strong uptake run
